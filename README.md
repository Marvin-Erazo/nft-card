## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS] (https://sass-lang.com) - For stylesheet


### What I learned

Is my fisrt time using mobile first workflow although the dimension of qr component is also small then this see good in mobile and dektop to responsive i only change the width of the qr div content for the margins

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .nft-card{
        width: 80%;
    }
}
```
### Continued development

The responsive desing is very hard for my because in some landing pages i need change many elements to create the website, i try to use as little code as possible also with the dimensions, i dont know when i should use px or pt or %
